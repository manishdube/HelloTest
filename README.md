first month- 
2 weeks was a wash with limoted access to systems 
No KT plan in place. 1 intro video was provided
first month - tasked with Creating a performance testing strategy based on a ppt deck that was doing it incorrectly using selenium for UI tests
Second month until month 3 - tasked with creating an strategy for GBSCAF to on AWS, without much requirements and communication i was tasked with comming up with a strategy, implementation plan, tactical tasking plan and everything in between and was asked to deliver on this failing project which was started 8 months ago. 
Was able to deliver the strategy and detailed plan after many revisions and re-inventing of the concepts and finally able to land on serverless Gitlan runners on AWS.
Significant work was performed on the Gitlab runners scalability front.

provide an organised view to the above using corporate language and mid year review

Here's a revised mid-year review summary that maintains candor but is more kind and constructive:

### Mid-Year Review Summary

**First Month:**

- **Initial Challenges:**
  - The first two weeks were unproductive due to limited access to essential systems.
  - There was no Knowledge Transfer (KT) plan in place, creating difficulties during the onboarding process.
  - Only a single introductory video was provided, which did not suffice for effective orientation.

- **Key Task:**
  - Developed a performance testing strategy. Initially, the provided PPT deck suggested using Selenium for UI tests, which was not suitable for performance testing. Identified and corrected this approach, resulting in a more effective strategy.

**Second Month to Third Month:**

- **Strategic Initiative:**
  - Assigned to create a strategy for GBSCAF on AWS despite limited requirements and communication.
  - Developed a comprehensive strategy, implementation plan, and tactical tasking plan for a project that had been ongoing for 8 months.
  - Delivered a detailed plan after several revisions, culminating in the adoption of serverless GitLab runners on AWS.
  - Made significant improvements to the scalability of GitLab runners.

- **Architectural Improvement:**
  - Identified a critical architectural flaw related to information flow and knowledge dependencies.
  - Collaborated with leadership to address the flaw and implement necessary strategy changes.
  - Unblocked key knowledge dependencies, ensuring smoother information flow and improved overall system performance.
