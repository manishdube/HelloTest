### Key Takeaways
- **Postman**: Ideal for quick setup and small to medium projects. It offers an intuitive interface for creating and managing mocks easily.
- **AWS (API Gateway & CloudFormation)**: Best suited for large-scale, enterprise-level projects needing high scalability and advanced configurations.
- **WireMock** and **MockServer**: Both are excellent for projects requiring detailed and realistic HTTP mocks, with moderate complexity in setup and maintenance.
